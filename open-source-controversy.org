Controversy over the "Open Source" Movement

* The freedoms espoused by the free software movement are important because they promote solidarity and sharing with your neighbor
* The Open Source marketing campaign has caused a lot of people to use free software, but they are not aware of the ethical underpinnings that are associated with the free software movement
* Some people prefer the term open source
** It avoids confusion between gratis and libre
** It appeals more to business
* Open Source focuses on free software as a methodology for producing better software
* The term open source has also been stretched beyond it's intended meaning
* The two camps often work together, but sometimes disagree
* Open source DRM is an example where the camps do not agree
** The open source methodology may result in more powerful and reliable software, but since the software is designed to restrict it's users, it only becomes more effective at that task
* Open source has had the effect of reaching more people
* Once people are comfortable with open source, it may be easier to transition them to free software
