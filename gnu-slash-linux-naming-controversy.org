GNU/Linux Naming Controversy

* Names are important because they affect the way we think about things
* Some people consider the name irrelevant
* Some want GNU recognized in the name for the part it has played
* There are still challenges for free software and the GNU project wants to continue raising awareness
* The name Linux is not particularly tied to the free software ideals
* Linux is only one part of the system
