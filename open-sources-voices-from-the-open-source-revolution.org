Open Sources: Voices from the Open Source Revolution

* Introduction
** Linus Pauling vs. Watson and Crick
*** Watson and Crick first figured out the structure of DNA
*** There was competition between Watson/Crick's lab and that of Linus Pauling
*** Watson and Crick tried to keep it a secret, but this stifled scientific progress
** Science is Open Source
** There is profit in keeping secrets, but it is harmful to society
** RMS wanted free software and promoted it's benefits for freedom
** Businesses were not that interested in the freedom aspects
** A new marketing campaign was created with the term "Open Source"
** The Open Source definition is not as strict as the GNU GPL
** Industry can provide a great dea of funding for research, but they have vested interests
** Some companies make money from Open Source, such as Red Hat
*** Money can be made from offering convenience, service, and support
*** Sendmail offers a proprietary version, and an open source version that lags one year behind
** Open Source supports innovation
*** Sharing makes software more robust
*** Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow
*** Minimizes duplication of effort
*** Someone can pick up where another leaves off
**** This is a common issue in software development - a persons interest and passion wanes after a while
** Open Source is doing very well in the server space
*** Apache controls over half the web serving market
*** Microsoft claims over half
**** But they exclude open source solutions
**** In total they control 20%
*** Proprietary *NIXes are struggling against Linux
** There is a risk of forks
*** Sufficiently open development processes reduce the incidence of detrimental forks
** Many Open Source developers get a reputation from their work
*** This benefits them in finding jobs
*** They also like te ego stroking
*** Developers can be passionate about the project and not feel "forced" to do it
** Open Source may be an area of great investment in the future (as of writing, hasn't materialized to the extent the author suggests)
** The Internet has made information sharing much easier
*** This has benefitted Open Source greatly
*** Open Source may be an idea whose time has come
* The Revenge of the Hackers
** ESR was surprised at the quality of Linux
** Brook's Law implied hat such a project should be a flailing mess
** They seemed to have a method that worked very well, but could not put it into words
** ESR wrote the Cathedral and the Bazaar as an attempt to explain it
** Netscape open sourced Netscape in an attempt to fight back against Microsoft
*** CatB had a big impact on Netscape
*** ESR claims that it was a fundamental inspiration, but this is contested
*** CEO of Netscape claims they were already considering it
** The success of Netscape was considered critical for the hacker culture to be taken seriously by business
** A marketing campaign was required - the "Open Source" brand was that marketing campaign
** Association with the term "free software" was considered harmful to the brand
*** gratis/libre confusion
*** perceived hostility towards "intellectual property"
** Key themes of the tactics that would be used
*** A focus on capturing the attention of top management, rather than appealing to engineers at the bottom
*** Linux as the poster child
*** Aim at fortune 500 companies
*** Capturing mainstream media
*** Open Source certification to prevent corruption by large vendors
** A public face was needed to capture the media's attention: ESR took on the job
** There was some concern that the free software community would not buy into the new brand, but many people did
** The less extreme position of Open Source was favored by some over the more philosophical Free Software
** GUIs may be the factor limiting adoption of open source software
* The Open Source Definition
** Open Source gives software a longer usable life and allows users to always access the latest versions
** The Open Source Definition is a bill of rights for the computer user
** These rights keep contributors on a level playing field
** The success of open source is partially because the software can be copied at little cost
